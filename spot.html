  	<p class = "para">Pulau Seletar (or Seletar Island) is an island situated in the Straits of Johor off the northern coast of Singapore.Located within Singapore waters, it has an area of 38.5 hectare. It lies within a bay into which several streams flow, including the waters of mainland Singapore's only hot spring. Pulau Seletar forms a single subzone of its own, located within the planning area of Simpang. It is also home to mangrove trees, the tallest of which reach a height of 80 feet. <br>

You might even catch a glimpse of some flames ... I don't really know where the flame is from though... Amidst this covid-19 situation, perhaps you can come here and reminisce on what it is like to be able to go to JB conveniently for cheap food and items. Hmm.

  	<p class = "para">In a magical instance, two islands rose from the sea. Well in the case of Pulau Punggol, it was not quite so magical. It was through an announcement in 1995 that the public came to know of the two reclaimed islands off Seletar - Pulau Punggol Barat and Pulau Punggol Timor, or West Punggol Island and East Punggol Island. However, they’re mostly undeveloped as compared to the main island. Recently, a Malaysian minister proposed constructing a third Singapore-Malaysia bridge crossing into Pulau Punggol Barat. Maybe if that happens, the two islands won’t be that ulu anymore. This island also see a 3.7 Kilometre long fence to deter illegal immigrants from landing on this island. It has happened before. :o <br>

  	<p class = "para">Seletar Fishing Village is probably one of the last places in Singapore where you can find local fishermen making a living by the sea. There are several huts located along the shore, and each has its own wooden boardwalk stretched into the open waters. The fishing village is said to be owned by an old fisherman who used to live nearby at Pulau Punggol Barat, but his former village ceased to exist due to the development and building of roads to the island. Most of the fishermen, a mixture of Chinese and Malay, at Seletar fishing village do not actually live there. The little kampong-styled huts are more like a working place for them, where fishing nets, buckets and fuels for the boats are stored. Nevertheless, many are attracted by the rustic and rural feel of this place, where they can also buy fresh seafood from the fishermen at affordable prices. The conditions of the fishing village may not be ideal for a city dweller though. The wooden boardwalks, and some huts, are built on stilts on the swampy lands infested by mosquitoes and filled with garbage and animal carcasses.<br>

  	<p class = "para">Seletar Aerospace Park is an industrial park in Singapore catering to the aerospace industries. Located in Seletar, the S$60 million plan to develop 140 hectares of land adjacent to Seletar Airport will further strengthen Singapore's position as an aviation hub. The development of the new aerospace park is geared towards delivering additional space for industry expansion, and complement existing aerospace activities at Changi North and Loyang. Fun fact: Firefly was supposed to use Seletar Airport for their services, but ... I guess not now. <br>

  	<p class = "para">Lower Seletar Reservoir is a reservoir located in the northern part of Singapore, to the east of Yishun New Town. The reservoir has a surface area of 3.6 km², and a capacity of 9.5 million m³. The mean depth of the reservoir is 2 m, with a maximum depth of 5.5 m. The shoreline length is 14.3 km. Lower Seletar Reservoir was constructed under the Sungei Seletar/Bedok Water Scheme, completed in 1986. The scheme involved the damming of Sungei Seletar to form Lower Seletar Reservoir, the creation of Bedok Reservoir from a former sand quarry and the construction of Bedok Waterworks. Its unique feature was the construction of nine stormwater collection stations to tap the storm runoffs of the surrounding urbanised catchments. The image above is the view from Lower Seletar Resevoir Park, another scenic place to check out if you are in Yishun! <br>

  	<p class = "para">It was in 1990 that the late Mr Ong Teng Cheong, then Secretary-General of NTUC, set out the reasons of developing a golf and country club for Singaporean workers. He envisioned in making golfing accessible and affordable to workers which also helped to strengthen their belief that progress of Singapore is shared by them, and that ‘golf will no longer be a game for the executives only’. From the Yishun Dam, you can clearly see some of the golf course! <br>
